## Motivational for the project  
Once the students come into pre final and final years of their graduation, all they worry about is getting into a good company. And also once the alumni pass out of college it becomes difficult for them to know what all is happening in the college. So the idea was solely based on these two experiences, of students and of alumni. The main purpose of this project is to bring together students and alumni of the college on a single platform where they can communicate and collaborate with each other for their personal growth. The first thing that comes to mind when taking up such a project is the implementation architecture. We decided to go ahead with a web application, since web applications can be used on any device running any up to date browsers, irrespective of the device.  

## Features  
• The first time a user visits the platform he or she will have a provision to create their
own profile and be able to login with the credentials they have provided.  
• Once the users are registered, they can login and access different features provided by the platform.  
• They will have the option to add job vacancies and view job vacancies posted by other alumni.  
• The students will have provision to post the different activities conducted by various clubs of college.  
• Students will also be able to to access the job vacancies and apply for a job of their choice.  
• The data as to which student is applying for which job will also be maintained and be kept as a record for reference.  
• The college activities and job vacancies will automatically be deleted from the database after they have been expired, by some prebuilt triggers.  
• Each user can visit their own profile on the website and decide to either update or
completely delete their account on the platform and they can also view their activity on the platform.  

## Implementation and tools used
When it comes to developing a web application, choosing a web framework that suits all our needs is a tedious task. Since we were developing a social web application we wanted a web framework that provided easy functionality. And we went ahead with Django. It's a python web framework. It provides all the provisions to develop and maintain the server side code. And for the front end we decided to go ahead with simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Building a web application comes with preloaded risks like cross site scripting and data theft. So building a safe and secure application was our top concern. Since Django provides built-in features for user creation, authorisation and maintenance, it was easy for us to implement the user handling. And even, other Django features came in handy when implementing other features. And the database that we decided to go ahead with was MySQL. This open source database is easy to handle and maintain.

## Conclusion and takeaways
Starting from scratch, making this web application work was a great learning experience throughout. Adhering to strict software engineering principles to make this project an impactful one, was of highest essence. And the team worked hard to make this project an impactful one. And isn't that the beauty of teamwork. Each one carries out their part of the work and then we integrate everything to make it a whole successful event.
